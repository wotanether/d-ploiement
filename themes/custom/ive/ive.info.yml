# This theme is marked as @internal. It is intended to evolve and change over
# minor releases.
# Change record https://www.drupal.org/node/2673014.
# As the UI of Drupal improves between minor versions, the mark up and assets
# in the ive theme will change. The ive theme is not backwards
# compatible. If you wish to modify the output or assets of ive you can:
# 1. Copy the whole of ive and rename it as your own theme. You will need to
# manually manage your own updates if you want to stay up to date with ive's
# bug fixes and feature support.
#
# 2. Sub-theme ive. This is only recommended if you want to make minor
# tweaks and understand that ive could break your modifications as it
# changes.
